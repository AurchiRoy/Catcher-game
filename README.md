# Description


The game was created using Python and PyOpenGL, leveraging the GLUT library to handle window creation and input management. It features a catcher that moves horizontally to catch a falling diamond, which is drawn using OpenGLâ€™s rendering capabilities, including the midpoint line algorithm and eight-way symmetry for efficient drawing of lines and shapes. The game mechanics include the diamond falling at a constant speed, with the player's score increasing as they successfully catch the diamond. The player can move the catcher using the left and right arrow keys and pause/resume the game using the space bar. The game operates in a 2D environment with a fixed window size of 400x400 pixels, and score tracking is implemented to display the final score when the game ends, either from the player catching the diamond or the diamond falling off the screen. The game uses glOrtho for orthographic projection, updating the game state and refreshing the display at regular intervals.
